    "\n",
    "> In general **Learning from Data** is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to infer (from data) a  model that allows *compact representation* (unsupervised learning) and/or *good generalization* (supervised learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important technology because it enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these algorithms are based on the *iterative solution* of a mathematical problem that involves data and model. If there was an analytical solution to the problem, this should be the adopted one, but this is not the case for most of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the most common strategy for **learning from data** is based on solving a system of equations as a way to find a series of parameters of the model that minimizes a mathematical problem. This is called **optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important technique for solving optimization problems is **gradient descend**."

    "### Sigmoid Cross-Entropy Loss (Softmax classifier)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Entropy is a loss function that is very used for training multiclass problems. We'll focus on models that assume that classes are mutually exclusive. In this case, our labels have this form $\\mathbf{y}_i =(1.0,0.0,0.0)$. If our model predicts a different distribution, say  $ f(\\mathbf{x}_i)=(0.4,0.1,0.5)$, then we'd like to nudge the parameters so that $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ gets closer to $\\mathbf{y}_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "C.Shannon showeed that if you want to send a series of messages composed of symbols from an alphabet with distribution $y$ ($y_j$  is the probability of the  $j$-th symbol), then to use the smallest number of bits on average, you should assign  $\\log(\\frac{1}{y_j})$  bits to the  $j$-th symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of bits is known as **entropy**:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ H(y, \\hat y) =   - \\sum_j y_j \\log \\hat y_j $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the real distribution is $\\mathbf{y}$ and the \"wrong\" one is $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$. So, minimizing **cross entropy** with respect our model parameters will result in the model that best approximates our labels if considered as a probabilistic distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cross entropy is used in combination with **Softmax** classifier. In order to classify $\\mathbf{x}_i$ we could take the index corresponding to the max value of $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$, but Softmax gives a slightly more intuitive output (normalized class probabilities) and also has a probabilistic interpretation:\n",

    "SGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply in one dimension than in another, which are common around local optima. In these scenarios, SGD oscillates across the slopes of the ravine while only making hesitant progress along the bottom towards the local optimum.\n",

    "Momentum is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector:\n",
